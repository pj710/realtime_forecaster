# Real-Time Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization

## Overview

Illustration of an advanced, end-to-end pipeline that forecasts product demand in real time and integrates the forecasts into inventory optimization strategies.

## Objectives

1. Design and build ETL Pipeline to pull historical sales data and store in database.
2. Develop accurate forecasting Model to predict demand product categories and minimize inventory costs.
3. Build a simulation or optimization algorithm (e.g., linear programming) to suggest reorder points and safety stocks.
4. Create interactive Dashboard to Visualize forecasts, Actual Sales and Inventory Recommendations.
